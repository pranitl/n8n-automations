# Google My Business Optimization Guide
## Home Care Business - Multi-Town Strategy

### What is Google My Business (GMB)?
Google My Business is your **FREE** business listing that appears when someone searches for home care services in your area. It's the box that shows up on the right side of Google search results with your business info, reviews, photos, and hours.

**Why it's crucial for home care:** When families search "home care near me" or "senior care in Cambridge," your GMB listing can be the first thing they see - even before your website!
